## Logistic_SVM_KNN-Models
Here Simple Logistic Regression, SVM and KNN Models are created for same dataset to compare performance

# Logistic
Here breast cancer dataset is taken from sklearn library which is classified using sklearn logistic model and using keras logistic model to compare both performance. Confusion matrix is added to know its performance.

# SVM and KNN
In this, same breast cancer dataset is taken from sklearn library which is classified using sklearn SVM model and using KNN model to compare both performance. Confusion matrix is added to know its performance.

This repo is to compare different techniques for same dataset how performance varies and which can be further improve it.
